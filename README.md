# Description of the project
Growing up, each member of our group had a profound love of retro videogames such as Space Invaders, Galaga, and Centepede.
We drew heavy inspiration from these space style shooters to help create Metaverse Vanguard, a 3D space shooter set in
the distant future and above the planet Deehmtee where the player will take on the role of the defender of the metaverse where they will pilot the D-Wing
starfighter to protect the metaverse and all metaversians from the threat of the oncoming invaders. The player controls their ship and
uses the latest galactic blasters with the help of mysterious space powerups to battle the oncoming invaders in a tense mission where all it at stake

# Instructions for use

- Connect a VR Headset for a Virtual Reality Experience
- Press F5 at any time to change camera perspective when in PC Mode
- Use Arrow Keys to Control your Ship
- Press Space to Fire
- Collect powerups to help you along the way
- Avoid letting invaders past you


# How it works
The player controls a ship flying above the surface of the planet Deehmtee, facing the threat of alien invaders. The invaders are slowly heading towards the player oscelating from side to side. 
You the player must fend off these invaders using the weapons on your ship whilst collecting power-ups to resore health and increase the effectiveness of your weapons.
The game ends when the player's health reaches zero by letting too many invaders slip past.
Are you up for the task?

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

*Aleksey:*
"Making all the models that are used in the project, apart from the space invader, however it is still modified to fit our thematic and textured to suit."
What I learned
"This project allowed mt to learn the basics of games design and go through the process of creating models to be used. Learning how to use blender would help me with my final year project, as it is to create 3D models."

*Jamie:*
I am most proud of the mechanics of the Starship and Enemy movement as I feel they have a modern yet also retro feel and control to them. Not too clunky but not too floaty either.
Learning the intricacies of game development, how different scenes and nodes interact with one another and the complexities that come along with creating a game that runs efficiently and is fun to play

*Finn*
Working on game logic with trying to tie it all together with the nessary scenes and different node types was where most of the enjoyment came for me personally. 
Another thing I enjoyed working on was the two particle effect scenes, which provided a lot of detail to the overall game. They were simple to code but most of the work on them came from manipulating the particle nodes within the scene through the Godot inspector. The different processing techniques gave a satisfying effect to the end  particles. It gave me good experience with game engine features that I didnt necessarily understand before.
