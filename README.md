# Description of the project
Growing up, each member of our group had a profound love of retro videogames such as Space Invaders, Galaga, and Centepede.
We drew heavy inspiration from these space style shooters to help create Metaverse Vanguard, a 3D space shooter set in
the distant future and above the planet Deehmtee where the player will take on the role of the defender of the metaverse where they will pilot the D-Wing
starfighter to protect the metaverse and all metaversians from the threat of the oncoming invaders. The player controls their ship and
uses the latest galactic blasters with the help of mysterious space powerups to battle the oncoming invaders in a tense mission where all it at stake

# Instructions for use

- Connect a VR Headset for a Virtual Reality Experience
- Press F5 at any time to change camera perspective when in PC Mode
- Use Arrow Keys to Control your Ship
- Press Space to Fire


# How it works
The player controls a ship flying above the surface of the planet Deehmtee, facing the threat of alien invaders. The invaders are slowly heading towards the player oscelating from side to side. 
You the player must fend off these invaders using the weapons on your ship whilst collecting power-ups to resore health and increase the effectiveness of your weapons.
The game ends when the player's health reaches zero by letting too many invaders slip past.
Are you up for the task?

# References
Space Invaders - Inspiration for game mechanics.

Centipede - Inspiration for power-up system.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

Aleksey:
"Making all the models that are used in the project, apart from the space invader, however it is still modified to fit our thematic and textured to suit."

What I learned
Aleksey:
"This project allowed mt to learn the basics of games design and go through the process of creating models to be used. Learning how to use blender would help me with my final year project, as it is to create 3D models."

Jamie:
Learning the intricacies of game development, how different scenes and nodes interact with one another and the complexities that come along with creating a game that runs efficiently and is fun to play

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
